# AWS-Analytics-Pipeline-Vizualization
For this project, I would like to use AWS Services for data processing and vizualization.

## Features

- **Amazon S3:** To Upload and store datasets.
- **AWS Glue:** For Data cataloging, ETL jobs for data transformation.
- **Amazon Athena:** To Query data stored in S3 using SQL.
- **Amazon QuickSight:** To Visualize queried data through interactive dashboards.
